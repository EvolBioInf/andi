#compdef andi

# This file allows zsh to complete arguments for andi. As the syntax is
# totally non-obvious, I'll explain the basics here. For details see
#  http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html
# Each line consists of three parts: (A){B}[C]
# The B part performs brace expansion as on the commandline. Thus each
# line with braces gets translated into multiple arguments! Also the
# B part lists the relevant argument for which we are trying to set
# the completion rules. The A part simply states that B shall not be
# completed if A is already present. i.e. Most flags only make sense once,
# with the exception of -v. The string C is simply the message that is
# displayed to the user.
